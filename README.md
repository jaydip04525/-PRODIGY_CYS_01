# Caesar Cipher Encryptor and Decryptor
This is a simple Python implementation of the Caesar Cipher, one of the oldest and easiest encryption techniques.
# ðŸ“ŒFeatures:
-Encrypts and decrypts any text using Caesar Cipher logic.
-User chooses between encryption or decryption.
-Allows input of custom key value (1â€“26).
- Handles both letters and non-letter characters (symbols, numbers stay unchanged).
- Automatically converts text to lowercase.
# ðŸ’»How It Works
- Encryption: Each letter in the plaintext is shifted forward by the key.
- Decryption: Each letter in the ciphertext is shifted backward by the key.

 For example, with a key of 3:
- a becomes d
- x becomes a
# â–¶ Usage
1. Run the script in any Python environment.
2. Choose e to encrypt or d to decrypt.
3. Enter the key (1â€“26).
4. Enter the text.
# ðŸ”‘ Example
* CAESAR CIPHER PROGRAM *

Do you want to encrypt or decrypt?
e/d: e

ENCRYPTION MODE SELECTED
Enter the key (1 through 26): 3

Enter the text to encrypt: hello

CIPHERTEXT: khoor
